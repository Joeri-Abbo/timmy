# Lazy loading

Timmy leaves it to you if you want to apply lazy loading to images and which JavaScript library you want to use for it (for example: [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes)) or [lozad](https://github.com/ApoorvSaxena/lozad.js). Because most of the lazy-loading libraries make use of `data` attributes to save the src and srcset attributes, Timmy provides a filter that converts your `srcset=""` into `data-srcset=""`.

```twig
<img{{ post.thumbnail|get_timber_image_responsive('custom-6')|lazy }}>
```

The `lazy` filter will only convert `srcset` attributes, but not `src` attributes. If you still need that, you can instead pass an option to the `get_timber_image_responsive()` function with your desired settings. Additionally to `lazy_src`, you can also pass `lazy_sizes` to convert the `sizes` attribute to `data-sizes`.

```twig
<img{{ post.thumbnail|get_timber_image_responsive('custom-6', {
    lazy_srcset: true,
    lazy_src: true,
    lazy_sizes: true
}) }}>
```

## Remarks

- If you need other markup, wrap the markup that is returned from Timmy with your own filter.
- If you use [Picturefill](https://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/), then you need to call `picturefill()` after the images were lazy loaded to make them work in browsers that donâ€™t support responsive images by default. Most lazy loading libraries provide a callback for that.
